description: >
  AI-based video analysis system for futsal games, developed during my final-year project at SportScore.
  The pipeline detects, classifies, and structures player actions (passes, shots, interceptions, goals) from futsal videos,
  with intelligent filtering of irrelevant frames.

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project focuses on **automated understanding of futsal gameplay** using a custom computer vision pipeline.

We built an **end-to-end video analysis system** capable of detecting, tracking, and classifying key player actions
using state-of-the-art deep learning models.

## ðŸ§© System Architecture
Hereâ€™s a simplified diagram of the processing pipeline:

1. **Detection**: YOLOv11 detects players and ball in each frame.  
2. **Tracking**: DeepSORT assigns consistent IDs to players across frames.  
3. **Action Recognition**: A CNN-LSTM model classifies temporal actions like passes or shots.  
4. **Event Structuring**: Filter and summarize the game into meaningful stats and highlights.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Multi-player tracking and re-identification  
- Intelligent frame selection and filtering  
- Action classification with deep learning  
- Real-time performance optimization
