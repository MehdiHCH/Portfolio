# **About Me**

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m **{{ site.author.name }}**,  
an **Artificial Intelligence Engineer** passionate about **Computer Vision**, **Deep Learning**, and the application of AI in **sports performance and analytics**.

During my recent projects, I built complete video analysis systems for sports â€” combining **object detection (YOLOv8/11)**, **multi-player tracking (DeepSORT / ReID)**, **jersey number OCR**, and **top-down projection** for tactical insights.  

I also explore **OCR modeling (CRNN, Vision Transformers)**, **event detection**, and **synthetic data generation** to improve model robustness in real-world scenarios.
